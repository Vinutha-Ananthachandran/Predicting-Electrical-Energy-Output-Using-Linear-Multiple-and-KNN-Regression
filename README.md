Predicting the Electrical Energy Output of Combined Cycle Power Plant Using Linear, Multiple, and KNN Regression
1. Data Source - Data is collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant for over 6 years starting from 2006 to 2011, when the power plant was set to work with full load.
2. Data Description -  Hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP),Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V).
3. Models built - Linear Regressor, Multiple Regressor, and KNN regressor.
